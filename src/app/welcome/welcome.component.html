    <h2>Build Web Apps With Angular!</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    Angular is one of the most popular modern web development frameworks out
    there!
  </p>
  <p>
    It's getting used by thousands of developers and companies since it allows
    developers to build powerful, highly interactive web applications with ease!
  </p>
  <p>
    Whilst you could use "just JavaScript" to build such applications, Angular
    vastly simplifies the process and allows you to build applications with a
    clear, modular structure - a feature that's especially important as
    applications become more complex.

<!--the goal of using this feature is to help us in rendering component or our views page conditionnaly
like here we have the trigger interaction: this means that if you click on the placeholder "by placeholder i refer to that code inside of the @placeholder block" you will see the component render in your application
the prefetch on hover means that if you hover your mouse on the placeholder the lazy load of the views will be trigger but you can only render the view if you click on the placeholder  -->
@defer( on interaction; prefetch on hover) {
<app-offer-preview />
